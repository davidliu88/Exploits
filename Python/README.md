# Python Exploits
These are all of the Python exploits that i personally know about.

### Requesrs
This is a `setup.py` exploit that allows you to create and run any file on the computer that installs the infected library.

I decided to name this exploit **Requesrs** so that if someone types an R instead of a T it will run this RansomWare https://github.com/b8ff/RansomWare. It's just a prank! :D

You can test this exploit by installing the library i made `pip install requesrs`. (DO IT ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE)

Once you run `pip install requesrs` PIP will open this RansomWare `https://github.com/b8ff/RansomWare` which is pretty simple and easily detectable, obviously the library `requesrs` is a showcase library but you can make your own less detectable library really easily.
